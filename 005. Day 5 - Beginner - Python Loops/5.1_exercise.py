# Instructions
#
# You are going to write a program that calculates
# the average student height from a List of heights.
#
# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in
# your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality
# using what you have learnt about for loops.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
    student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your code below this row ğŸ‘‡

height_sum = 0
height_count = 0
for height in student_heights:
    height_sum += height
    height_count += 1

average = height_sum / height_count

print(f"Average: {round(average)}")
